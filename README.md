🚀 Pulsar Star Classification using Machine Learning | SVM, EDA & Hyperparameter Tuning 🌌✨

In this project, I implemented an advanced Support Vector Machines (SVM) classifier to accurately classify pulsar stars as either legitimate or spurious ⭐. Using the Pulsar Star Dataset from Kaggle, I performed a complete end-to-end data science workflow:

🔍 Key Highlights:

📊 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) for deep data insights

⚙️ Feature engineering & feature scaling for model readiness

🔬 Applied SVM with multiple kernels: linear, polynomial, RBF, sigmoid

✅ Evaluated performance using confusion matrix, classification metrics, and ROC-AUC

🔄 Stratified k-fold Cross Validation for robust model validation

🔍 Hyperparameter tuning with GridSearchCV to find optimal parameters

📈 Tools & Tech Stack: Python, Pandas, Scikit-Learn, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn

🎯 Result: Achieved a reliable classifier to distinguish rare legitimate pulsar stars from noisy signals — showcasing practical machine learning for astrophysics applications.# Pulsar-Star-Classification
